TubeTK ComputeTrainingMask Application
=============================================

#### Overview:

Given an expert vessel mask volume this application defines the vessel and not-vessel volume mask.

#### Usage:

```
   ComputeTrainingMask  [--notVesselWidth <double>]
              [--gap <double>
              [--notVesselMask]
              [--xml] [--echo]
              [--][--version] [-h]
              <std::string> <std::string>


Where:

   -notVesselWidth <double>
     (required) A double value specifying the width around the region
     marked as vessel by an expert, that would be regarded as not-vessel
     expert mask.

   -gap <double>
     (required) A double value specifying the gap between the vessel
     region marked by an expert and the not-vessel region.

   --xml
     Produce xml description of command line arguments (default: 0)

   --echo
     Echo the command line arguments (default: 0)

   -notVesselMask
     The not-vessel expert mask is saved as an image in the location specified by the
     string "notVesselMask"

   --,  --ignore_rest
     Ignores the rest of the labeled arguments following this flag.

   --version
     Displays version information and exits.

   -h,  --help
     Displays usage information and exits.

   <std::string>
     (required)  Input image file containing the expert marked vessel.

   <std::string>
     (required)  Output image file containing vessel mask.


   Description: Return image file containing the vessel mask.

#### Algorithm:

1. **Get the input tubes:**
 The first step is to read the input image. The input image is an expert vessel mask,
 where an expert has marked the regions which are vessels.

2. **Compute the centerlines from the masked input**
 All the masked labelled regions in the input are evaluated and a thin centerline is
 generated passing through the center of those masked regions. Binary Thinning Image
 Filter is used.

 * **Threshold and Morphology Image Filter**
 A series of threshold and morphology image filters are applied to the input image.

3. **Write Output image file**
 The final vessel mask is writen as an image file.
